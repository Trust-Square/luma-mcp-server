## Tips for AI Agents

1. **Calendar Context**: Always be aware of which calendar is active. Include the calendar name in responses when showing events or guests.

2. **Smart Calendar Switching**: If a user mentions "work events" or "personal calendar", consider switching to the appropriate calendar automatically.

3. **Always validate first**: The configure_calendar tool validates by default, helping catch issues early.

4. **Use natural language**: Convert technical parameters into user-friendly language:
   - "next week" ‚Üí calculate actual date ranges
   - "7 PM" ‚Üí convert to proper ISO 8601 format with timezone

5. **Provide context**: When showing results, add helpful context like event counts, types, and summaries.

6. **Handle pagination gracefully**: Use get_all_* tools for complete data, or mention when there are more results available.

7. **Two-step updates**: Always show proposed changes before applying them, giving users a chance to review.
