```

### No API Key Configured

```
Human: What events do I have?

[Attempts to call list_events]

## Tips for AI Agents

1. **Always validate first**: The configure_luma tool validates by default, helping catch issues early.

2. **Use natural language**: Convert technical parameters into user-friendly language:
   - "next week" ‚Üí calculate actual date ranges
   - "7 PM" ‚Üí convert to proper ISO 8601 format with timezone

3. **Provide context**: When showing results, add helpful context like event counts, types, and summaries.

4. **Handle pagination gracefully**: Use get_all_* tools for complete data, or mention when there are more results available.

5. **Two-step updates**: Always show proposed changes before applying them, giving users a chance to review.
